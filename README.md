# JavaFXTeamProject

In order to run your project through intelij
--DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP--   First try to run Main class. --DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP--

You will fail.

So now you can see, just near to the play button, box with "Main" write in it added.

Click on the main, and then click "Edit Configuration"

You'll need to add under _VM option this:

-p path_to_javafx_on_your_computer/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml

CHANGE path_to_javafx_on_your_computer TO THE RIGHT PATH!!!!
